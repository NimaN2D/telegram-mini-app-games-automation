# Hamster Kombat Game Automation

This Laravel 11 project automates the Hamster Kombat Game by handling taps and purchasing upgrades based on the configured strategies.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Laravel Sail
- PHP 8.2 or higher
- Composer

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NimaN2D/telegram-web-game-hamster-auto-play.git
    cd telegram-web-game-hamster-auto-play
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and update the environment variables.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
    ```dotenv
    HAMSTER_INIT_DATA_RAW=your_init_data_raw_here
    HAMSTER_FINGERPRINT=your_fingerprint_json_here
    HAMSTER_SPEND_PERCENTAGE=0.20
    HAMSTER_MIN_BALANCE=100000000
    ```

   To obtain the `HAMSTER_INIT_DATA_RAW` and `HAMSTER_FINGERPRINT` variables, follow these steps:

    1. Open the Telegram web version in the Chrome browser on your desktop by navigating to [https://web.telegram.org/k](https://web.telegram.org/k) and log into your Telegram account.
    2. Enter the Hamster Kombat bot by clicking on the link [@hamster_kombat_bot](https://t.me/hamster_kombat_bot).
    3. Click on the "play" button to load the game. You will see a message indicating that the game can only be played on mobile.
    4. Press `F12` on your keyboard to open the Chrome Developer Tools. Clear the Console by clicking on the icon that looks like a no-entry sign.
    5. Copy and paste the following code into the Console and press Enter:
        ```javascript
        const iframe = document.getElementsByTagName('iframe')[0];
        iframe.src = iframe.src.replace(/(tgWebAppPlatform=)[^&]+/, "$1android");
        console.log("üêπ Hamster:", iframe.src);
        ```
    6. After entering the code, you will be provided with a link. Copy this link and open it directly in your browser's address bar.
    7. Tap one time in the game and then open the Developer Tools (`F12`) again. Go to the Network tab and look for a request named `auth-by-telegram-webapp`.
    8. From the payload of this request, copy the `initDataRaw` and `fingerprint` variables and set them in your `.env` file.

5. **Docker Setup:**
    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/sail up
    ./vendor/bin/sail artisan migrate
    ```
