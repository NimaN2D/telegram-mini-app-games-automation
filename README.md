# Telegram Mini App Games Automation

This Laravel 11 project automates the Hamster Kombat and Musk Empire Games by handling taps and purchasing upgrades (improvements) based on the configured strategies.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NimaN2D/telegram-mini-app-games-automation.git
    cd telegram-mini-app-games-automation
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3. **Environment Configuration:**
   Copy the `.env.example` to `.env` and update the environment variables.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

4. **Set Environment Variables:**
    ```dotenv
    # Hamster configuration
    HAMSTER_INIT_DATA_RAW='INIT_DATA_RAW'
    HAMSTER_FINGERPRINT='FINGERPRINT'
    HAMSTER_SPEND_PERCENTAGE=100
    HAMSTER_MIN_BALANCE=0
    
    # Musk Empire configuration
    MUSK_EMPIRE_INIT_DATA='INIT_DATA'
    MUSK_EMPIRE_SPEND_PERCENTAGE=100
    MUSK_EMPIRE_MIN_BALANCE=0
    ```

   To obtain the `HAMSTER_INIT_DATA_RAW` and `HAMSTER_FINGERPRINT` variables, follow these steps:

    1. Open the Telegram web version in the Chrome browser on your desktop by navigating to [https://web.telegram.org/k](https://web.telegram.org/k) and log into your Telegram account.
    2. Enter the Hamster Kombat bot by clicking on the link [@hamster_kombat_bot](https://t.me/hamster_kombat_bot).
    3. Click on the "play" button to load the game. You will see a message indicating that the game can only be played on mobile.
    4. Press `F12` on your keyboard to open the Chrome Developer Tools. Clear the Console by clicking on the icon that looks like a no-entry sign.
    5. Copy and paste the following code into the Console and press Enter:
        ```javascript
        const iframe = document.getElementsByTagName('iframe')[0];
        iframe.src = iframe.src.replace(/(tgWebAppPlatform=)[^&]+/, "$1android");
        console.log("üêπ Hamster:", iframe.src);
        ```
    6. After entering the code, you will be provided with a link. Copy this link and open it directly in your browser's address bar.
    7. Tap one time in the game and then open the Developer Tools (`F12`) again. Go to the Network tab and look for a request named `auth-by-telegram-webapp`.
    8. From the payload of this request, copy the `initDataRaw` and `fingerprint` variables and set them in your `.env` file.

   To obtain the `MUSK_EMPIRE_INIT_DATA` variable, follow these steps:

    1. Open the Telegram web version in the Chrome browser on your desktop by navigating to [https://web.telegram.org/k](https://web.telegram.org/k) and log into your Telegram account.
    2. Enter the Musk Empire bot by clicking on the link [@muskempire_bot](https://t.me/muskempire_bot).
    3. Click on the "play" button to load the game. You will see a message indicating that the game can only be played on mobile.

        iframe.src = iframe.src.replace(/(tgWebAppPlatform=)[^&]+/, "$1android");
        ```
